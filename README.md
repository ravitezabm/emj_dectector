## Dataset
Due to the limitations of upload size in github, I have uploaded the zip file of the dataset 'data.zip' on a google drive.
Download the [data.zip](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1yCxHw7aOAPYTVz9VKm2Yax1sxLLtJgWk/view?usp=sharing) file and unzip it in the directory.

## Dependencies

1. Python 3.x, OpenCV 3 or 4, Tensorflow, TFlearn, Keras
2. Open terminal and enter the file path to the desired directory and install the following libraries
   * ``` pip install numpy```
   * ``` pip install opencv-python```
   * ``` pip install tensorflow```
   * ``` pip install tflearn```
   * ``` pip install keras```
   
## Execution

1. Unzip the 'data.zip' file in the same location
2. Open terminal and enter the file path to the desired directory and paste the command given below
3. ``` python kerasmodel.py --mode display```
